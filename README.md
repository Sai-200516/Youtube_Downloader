# Buck - YouTube Video Downloader ðŸ“¹

Buck is a user-friendly web application built with Flask that enables downloading YouTube videos in your preferred resolution and format. With a sleek interface, it supports resolutions from 240p to 720p and formats like MP4, MKV, and WEBM, making video downloading simple and efficient.

## Features
- **Customizable Downloads**: Choose video resolution (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p) and format (MP4, MKV, WEBM).
- **Intuitive Interface**: Enter a YouTube URL, select options, and download with a single click.
- **Server-Side Processing**: Downloads are handled securely on the backend, with files saved to a `downloads/` directory.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback for invalid URLs or download issues.
- **Lightweight Design**: Built to run locally with minimal dependencies.

## Used Libraries
The Buck YouTube Video Downloader relies on the following libraries:
- **Flask**: A Python web framework for routing, request handling, and rendering the web interface.
- **yt-dlp**: A powerful library for downloading YouTube videos, supporting various formats and resolutions.
- **os** (standard library): Manages file system operations, such as creating the `downloads/` directory.

External libraries (Flask, yt-dlp) are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
